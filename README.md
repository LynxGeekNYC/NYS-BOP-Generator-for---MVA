# General & Legal Disclaimer
I am not a lawyer. This script is not for legal advice. 

# NYS BOP Generator for MVA (PHP)
New York State BOP (Bill of Particulars) Generator for MVA (Motor Vehicle Accidents.

This script is designed to generate BP's as well as Discovery Responses and Demands.
Even though this script is open-source, I actually made this to automate my taks better
in the legal field because 99.99% of Personal Injury Case Management Systems suck at generating
effective BP's and Discovery Demands / Responses.

# Instructions

I have two variants of the script. One to generate PDF and one to Generate DOC File. I will include
specific code that fill in the caption of the pleading. Poor Thing(s) Vs. Careless, County, Court, Index #, etc.
